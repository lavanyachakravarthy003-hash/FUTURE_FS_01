# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is my personal professional portfolio website built as part of my Full Stack Web Development internship task.
The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills, projects, and background in a clean and professional way so recruiters, clients, and collaborators can easily understand my work.

The portfolio acts as my **digital resume + proof of work**, highlighting what I can build and how I present myself as a developer.
